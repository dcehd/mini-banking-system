Hello!

This project is on object-oriented programming (OOP), where we are tasked with creating an simple banking system with an Account Class which represents a bank account with:
- Account holder’s name
- Account number
- Account balance

---

Let the Account class have the following methods;
- deposit(amount) – Adds the amount to the balance.
- withdraw(amount) – Deducts the amount from the balance (if sufficient funds are available).
- get_balance() – Returns the current balance.

---

There's more examples included in the [questions file](https://github.com/dcehd/mini-banking-system/blob/changes/question.txt) for you to try out.
Enjoy!
